# Shell Basics Project

This project introduces the basics of Linux file system navigation and fundamental shell commands, designed for those new to programming. Through these tasks, learners will gain hands-on experience in viewing directory contents, understanding file structures, and writing simple shell scripts to perform common operations. The goal is to build a foundational understanding of how to navigate and manage files within the Linux command-line interface.

- Create a new repository named `system_engineering-devops`.
- Inside this repository, create a directory called `0x00-shell_basics` where all your script files for this project will be stored.

### Adding Files for Each Task

- Each task requires a unique script file. Create each script in the `0x00-shell_basics` directory, using the exact file names provided in each task description (e.g., `0-currentworkingdirectory`).

### Submitting Your Project
